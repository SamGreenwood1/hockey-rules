Adhesive tape of any color may be wrapped around the stick at any place for the purpose of reinforcement or to improve control of the puck.
No stick shall exceed sixty-three inches (63") in length from theheel to the end of the shaft nor more than twelve and one-half inches (121/2") from the heel to the end of the blade.
Requests for an exception to the length of the shaft (only) may be submitted in writing to and must be approved by the Hockey Operations Department prior to any such stick being used. Only players 6’6” tall or more will be considered for exception. Maximum length of a stick granted an exception under this rule is sixty-five inches (65”).

**10.2 Goalkeeper’s Stick** - In the case of a goalkeeper’s stick, there shall be a knob of white tape or other protective material approved by the League. This knob must not be less than one-half inch (1/2'') thick at the top of the shaft.
Failure to comply with this provision of the rule will result in the goalkeeper’s stick being deemed unfit for play. The goalkeeper’s stick must be changed without the assessment of a minor penalty.

The blade of the goalkeeper’s stick shall not exceed three and one-half inches (31/2'') in width at any point except at the heel, where it must not exceed four and one-half inches (41/2'') in width; nor shall the goalkeeper’s stick exceed fifteen and one-half inches (151/2'') in length from the heel to the end of the blade.

There is to be no measurement of any goalkeeper’s stick during the course of the game. The League’s Hockey Operations Department is specifically authorized to make a check of all goalkeepers’ sticks to ensure the compliance with the rule. It shall report its findings to the Commissioner for his disciplinary action (see 11.9).	

The widened portion of the goalkeeper’s stick extending up the shaft from the blade shall not extend more than twenty-six inches (26'') from the heel and shall not exceed three and one-half inches (31/2'') in width.

Requests for an exemption to the length of the paddle (only) may be submitted in writing to and must be approved by the Hockey Operations Department prior to any stick being approved. Only players 6’6” tall or more will be considered for exemption. Maximum length of a stick paddle granted an exception under this rule is twentysix inches (26”).

**10.3 Broken Stick** – Player - A broken stick is one which, in the opinion of the Referee, is unfit for normal play.
A player without a stick may participate in the game. 
A player whose stick is broken may participate in the game provided he drops the broken stick. A minor penalty shall be imposed for an infraction of this rule.
A player who has lost or broken his stick may receive a replacement stick by having one handed to him from his own players’ bench, by having one handed to him by a teammate on the ice or by picking up his own unbroken stick or that of a teammate from the ice. A player will be penalized if he throws or shoots a stick to a teammate on the ice, or if he picks up and plays with an opponent’s stick. A player may not participate in the play using a goalkeeper’s stick. A minor penalty shall be imposed for an infraction of this rule.
A player using a stick thrown on the ice from the players’ or penalty bench will not receive a penalty. However, the person responsible for throwing the stick will receive a bench minor penalty.

**10.4 Broken Stick** – Goalkeeper - A goalkeeper may continue to play with a broken stick until a stoppage of play or until he has one legally provided to him by a teammate. The teammate cannot throw or shoot it to the goalkeeper (this includes situations where the goalkeeper has lost his stick and a teammate is trying to return it to him). For a violation of this rule, a minor penalty for throwing the stick shall be assessed to the offending player (no penalty to the goalkeeper for receiving the stick).

A goalkeeper whose stick is broken or illegal may not go to the
players’ bench for a replacement but must receive his stick from a
teammate. A goalkeeper may participate in the play using a skater’s
stick until such time as he is legally provided with a replacement
goalkeeper’s stick.

For an infraction of this rule, a minor penalty shall be imposed on the goalkeeper.

**10.5 Stick Measurement** - A request for a stick measurement shall be limited to one request per team during the course of any stoppage in play.

When a formal complaint is made by the Captain or Alternate Captain of a team, against the dimensions of an opponent’s stick, that opponent must be on the ice at the time the request is made to the Referee. Once the request is made, and as long as the Officials maintain visual contact with the stick, it can be measured. This means hat if the player whose stick is about to be measured steps off the ice onto his players’ bench, his stick may still be measured provided the request was received prior to him leaving the ice surface and the stick remains in the view of at least one of the on-ice Officials.

The Referee shall take the stick to the penalty bench where the necessary measurement shall be made immediately. Players on both teams shall retire to their respective benches. To measure the curvature of the blade of the stick, the Referee must draw an imaginary line along the outside of the shaft to the bottom of the blade and then along the bottom of the blade - this will determine the location of the heel. Using a League-approved measuring gauge, the Referee shall secure the gauge at the heel of the stick and measure the curvature of the blade from the heel to \ any point along the toe of the blade. To measure any other dimension of the stick, the Referee shall use a measuring tape.

The result shall be reported to the Penalty Timekeeper, who shall record it on the back of the Penalty Record form. The Referee will convey the result of the measurement to the Captain or Alternate Captain of the team whose stick was measured. If the stick proves to be illegal, the stick shall remain at the penalty bench until the end of the game.

A player whose stick has been measured and it is found not to conform to the rule shall be assessed a minor penalty and a fine of two hundred dollars ($200). For a second offense in the same season, the player shall (in addition to the minor penalty) be fined one thousand dollars ($1000). For a third offense in the same season, the player shall (in addition to the minor penalty) be assessed a game misconduct and an automatic one game suspension. For all additional violations in the same season, the automatic suspension to the player shall (in addition to the minor penalty and game misconduct assessed during the game) double for each subsequent violation of this rule (i.e. first suspension - one game, second suspension - two games, third suspension – four games etc.) If the complaint is not sustained, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed against the complaining Club.
A player who participates in the play (i.e. checks or prevents the movement of an opponent or who plays the puck) while carrying two sticks (including while taking a replacement stick to his goalkeeper) shall incur a minor penalty under this rule. The automatic fine of two hundred dollars ($200) shall not be imposed. If this participation causes an infraction resulting in a penalty, the Referee shall report the incident to the Commissioner for disciplinary action. 
A request for a stick measurement in regular playing time is permitted, including after the scoring of a goal, however, a goal cannot be disallowed as a result of the measurement. A request for a stick measurement following a goal in overtime (including one scored on a penalty shot in overtime) is not permitted. Stick measurements prior to or during the shootout are permitted, subject to the guidelines outlined in 10.7.
Any player who deliberately breaks his stick or who refuses to surrender his stick for measurement when requested to do so by the Referee shall be assessed a minor penalty plus a ten-minute (10) misconduct. In addition, this player or goalkeeper shall be subject to a two hundred dollar ($200) fine.

**10.6 Stick Measurement** – Prior to Penalty Shot – A stick measurement request may be made prior to a penalty shot following these guidelines:

First Stick
If the stick is “legal” the complaining Club is assessed a bench minor penalty, and a player is placed in the penalty box immediately. Regardless as to the result of the shot, the bench minor penalty is assessed and served. 
If the stick is “illegal” the player will be assessed a minor penalty. He will be ordered to obtain a new (second) stick prior to the shot. After he takes the shot he will be required to serve his penalty.

Second stick
The player will be told that the second stick will be measured prior to the shot to verify the legality of the stick.
If the second stick is “legal”, proceed with the shot.
If second stick is “illegal”, disallow the opportunity for the shot and assess one minor penalty for the first illegal stick.
If the player refuses to surrender his stick for measurement, the shot shall not be permitted and the player shall be assessed a misconduct penalty.

**10.7 Stick Measurement** – Prior to Shootout Attempt – A stick measurement request must be made prior to the Referee blowing his whistle to begin the shootout attempt.

If the stick is “legal” the complaining Club forfeits their next shootout attempt. In addition, the complaining Club’s Coach shall be fined one thousand dollars ($1000) and the Club shall be fined five thousand dollars ($5000). Their next shootout attempt would be recorded as “no goal”.

If the stick is “illegal”, the offending team forfeits that shootout attempt by that player, and the player becomes ineligible to participate in the shootout. In addition, the player is fined one thousand dollars ($1000) and his Club is fined five thousand dollars ($5000). This
shootout attempt would be recorded as “no goal”.
Stick measurement violations during the shootout shall not be
subject to the fines and suspensions outlined in 10.5.

**10.8 Illegal Stick** – An illegal stick is defined as one that, following a measurement, is deemed not conforming to league rules. An illegal stick is also defined as one when a player has not been legally handed one by his players’ bench or from a teammate. And finally, an illegal stick is anytime a player on the ice attempts to play the game with an opponent’s stick.

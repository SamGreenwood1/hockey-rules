**7.1 Starting Line-up** - Prior to the start of the game, at the request of the Referee, the Manager or Coach of the visiting team is required to name the starting line-up to the Referee or Official Scorer.
Prior to the start of the game, the Manager or Coach of the home team, having been advised by the Official Scorer the names of the starting line-up of the visiting team, shall name the starting line-up of the home team. This information shall be conveyed by the Official Scorer to the Coach of the visiting team.
No change in the starting line-up of either team as given to the Official Scorer, or in the playing line-up on the ice, can be made unless reviewed and approved by the Referee prior to the start of the game.

**7.2 Violation** - For an infraction of this rule, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed upon the offending team. This is an appeal play and must be brought to the Referee’s attention prior to the second face-off in the game. There is no penalty to the requesting team if their appeal is unsustained. The determining factor is the player or goalkeeper’s name, and not necessarily the player or goalkeeper’s number, must be correctly listed by the team.
In the event a team scores on the first shift of the game, and it is brought to the attention of the Referee by the opposing team that the team that scored did not have the correct starting line-up on the ice, the goal shall be allowed and a bench minor penalty assessed to the offending team for having an improper starting line-up. If the team that scores a goal on the first shift of the game challenges the starting lineup of the opposing team and the opposing team did not have the correct starting line-up, the scoring of the goal would nullify the bench minor penalty and no further penalties would be assessed.

**8.1 Injured Player** - When a player is injured or compelled to leave the ice during a game, he may retire from the game and be replaced by a substitute, but play must continue without the teams leaving the ice.

During the play, if an injured player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, he must do so at the players’ bench and not through any other exit leading from the rink. This is not a legal player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed.	

If a penalized player has been injured, he may proceed to the dressing room without taking a seat on the penalty bench. If the injured player receives a minor penalty, the penalized team shall immediately put a substitute player on the penalty bench, who shall serve the penalty until such time as the injured player is able to return to the game. He would replace his teammate on the penalty bench at the next stoppage of play. If the injured player receives a major penalty, the penalized team shall place a substitute player on the penalty bench before the penalty expires and no other replacement for the penalized player shall be permitted to enter the game except from the penalty bench. For violation of this rule, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed.

Should the injured penalized player who has been replaced on the penalty bench return to his players’ bench prior to the expiration of his penalty, he shall not be eligible to play until his penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when his substitute is still in the penalty box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured player must wait until his substitute has been released from the penalty box before he is eligible to play. If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of his penalty, he must then replace his teammate on the penalty bench and is then eligible to return once his penalty has expired.

When a player is injured so that he cannot continue play or go to his bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured player’s team has secured control of the puck. If the player’s team is in control of the puck at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless his team is in a scoring position.
In the case where it is obvious that a player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesperson may stop the play immediately. 

When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured player, or whenever an injured player is attended to on the ice by the Trainer or medical personnel, such player must be substituted for immediately. This injured player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed.

When play is stopped for an injured player, the ensuing face-off shall be conducted at the face-off spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured player’s team has control of the puck in the attacking zone, the face-off shall be conducted at the nearest face-off spot in the neutral zone. When the injured player is in his defending zone and the attacking team is in possession of the puck in the attacking zone, the face-off shall be conducted at the nearest face-off spot in the defending team’s zone.

**8.2 Injured Goalkeeper** - If a goalkeeper sustains an injury or becomes ill, he must be ready to resume play immediately or be replaced by a substitute goalkeeper and no additional time shall be allowed for the purpose of enabling the injured or ill goalkeeper to resume his position. The substitute goalkeeper shall be allowed a two (2) minute warm-up during all pre-season games. No warm-up shall be permitted for a substitute goalkeeper in all regular League or Playoff games.
The Referee shall report to the Commissioner for disciplinary action any delay in making a goalkeeper substitution.

The substitute goalkeeper shall be subject to the regular rules governing goalkeepers and shall be entitled to the same privileges.
When a substitution for the regular goalkeeper has been made, such regular goalkeeper shall not resume his position until the next stoppage of play. For a violation of the rule, a minor penalty for delay of game shall be assessed.

When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured goalkeeper, such goalkeeper must be substituted for only if he has to proceed to the players’ bench to receive medical attention. If the Trainer has come onto the ice to attend to the goalkeeper and there is no undue delay, the goalkeeper may remain in the game. However, no additional time shall be permitted by the Referee for the purpose of enabling the injured goalkeeper to resume his position (i.e. no warm-up).

**8.3 Blood** – A player who is bleeding or who has visible blood on his equipment or body shall be ruled off the ice at the next stoppage of play. Such player shall not be permitted to return to play until the bleeding has been stopped and the cut or abrasion covered (if necessary). It is required that any affected equipment and/or uniform be properly decontaminated or exchanged.

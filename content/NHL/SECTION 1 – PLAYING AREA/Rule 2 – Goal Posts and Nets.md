**2.1 Goal Posts** - The goal posts shall be kept in position by means of flexible pegs affixed in the ice or floor. The flexible pegs shall be ten inches (10") in length and yellow in color.	
The goal posts shall be of approved design and material, extending vertically four feet (4') above the surface of the ice and set six feet (6') apart measured from the inside of the posts. A crossbar of the same material as the goal posts shall extend from the top of one post to the top of the other. See diagram on page v preceding table of contents.
The goal posts and crossbar shall be painted in red and all other exterior surfaces shall be painted in white.

**2.2 Nets** - There shall be attached to each goal frame a net of approved design made of white nylon cord which shall be draped in such a manner as to prevent the puck coming to rest on the outside of it, yet strung in a manner that will keep the puck in the net.
A skirt of heavy white nylon fabric or heavyweight white canvas shall be laced around the base plate of the goal frame in such a way as to protect the net from being cut or broken. This protective padding must be attached in a manner that will not restrict the puck from completely crossing the goal line. This padding must be set back six inches (6'') from the inside of the goal post. This skirt shall not project more than one inch (1'') above the base plate.
The frame of the goal shall be draped with a nylon mesh net so as to completely enclose the back of the frame. The knotless nylon netting shall be made of heat set, resin treatment twine (0.197 inch (5 mm) diameter) or equivalent braided twine of multifilament white nylon with an appropriate break strength of 550 to 600 pounds (250-275 kilograms). The size of the mesh shall be two and one-half inches (2½'') (inside measurement) from each knot to each diagonal knot when fully stretched. The net shall be laced to the frame with medium white nylon cord no smaller in size than No. 21.
The thin nylon mesh netting on the top of the goal frame shall be white 12 ply, four braid construction and 62 mm inside to inside mesh. This netting will be attached with 2.2 mm clear coated white twine of Dynemma braided construction.

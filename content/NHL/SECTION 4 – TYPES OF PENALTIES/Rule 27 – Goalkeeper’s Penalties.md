**27.1 Minor Penalty to Goalkeeper** – A goalkeeper shall not be sent to the penalty bench for an offense which incurs a minor penalty, but instead, the minor penalty shall be served by another member of his team who was on the ice when the offense was committed. This player is to be designated by the Coach of the offending team through the playing Captain and such substitute shall not be changed.

A penalized player may not serve a goalkeeper’s penalty.	

If the goalkeeper is involved in coincidental penalties being assessed and as a result, his team is required to play shorthanded due to additional penalties assessed to the goalkeeper, the player designated to serve the additional time penalties assessed to the goalkeeper may be any player as designated by the Coach of the offending team through the Captain.

**27.2 Major Penalty to Goalkeeper** – A goalkeeper shall not be sent to the penalty bench for an offense which incurs a major penalty, but instead, the major penalty shall be served immediately by another member of his team who was on the ice when the offense was committed. This player is to be designated by the Coach of the offending team through the Captain and such substitute shall not be changed.

When a goalkeeper is assessed a major penalty plus a game misconduct, which is coincidental with a major or match penalty to the opposing team, no player is required to serve the goalkeeper’s penalties in the penalty box, since he has been ejected from the game.

Should a goalkeeper incur three major penalties in one game, he shall be ruled off the ice for the balance of the game and his place shall be taken by a member of his own Club, or by a regular substitute goalkeeper who is available. Such player will be allowed the goalkeeper’s full equipment. (Major penalty plus game misconduct penalty.)

**27.3 Misconduct Penalty to Goalkeeper** – Should a goalkeeper on the ice incur a misconduct penalty, this penalty shall be served by another member of his team who was on the ice when the offense was committed. This player is to be designated by the Manager or Coach of the offending team through the Captain.

**27.4 Game Misconduct Penalty to Goalkeeper** – Should a goalkeeper incur a game misconduct penalty, his place will then be taken by a member of his own Club, or by a regular substitute goalkeeper who is available, and such player will be allowed the goalkeeper’s full equipment.

**27.5 Match Penalty to Goalkeeper** – Should a goalkeeper incur a match penalty, his place will then be taken by a member of his own Club, or by a substitute goalkeeper who is available, and such player will be allowed the goalkeeper’s full equipment.

The match penalty, and any additional penalties assessed to the goalkeeper, shall be served immediately by a member of the team on the ice when the offenses were committed. This player shall be designated by the Coach of the offending team through the Captain. However, when the match penalty is coincidental with a match or major penalty to the opposing team, no player is required to proceed to the penalty bench to serve the goalkeeper’s match penalty.

**27.6 Leaving Goal Crease** – A minor penalty shall be imposed on a goalkeeper who leaves the immediate vicinity of his crease during an altercation. In addition, he shall be reported to the Commissioner for further disciplinary action as may be required. However, should the altercation occur in or near the goalkeeper’s crease, the Referee should direct the goalkeeper to a neutral location and not assess a penalty for leaving the immediate vicinity of the goal crease. Equally, if the goalkeeper is legitimately outside the immediate vicinity of the goal crease for the purpose of proceeding to the players’ bench to be substituted for an extra attacker, and he subsequently becomes involved in an altercation, the minor penalty for leaving the crease would not be assessed.

In addition, during stoppages of play in the game, he must not proceed to his players’ bench for the purpose of receiving a replacement stick or equipment or repairs thereto, or due to an injury, or to receive instructions, without first obtaining permission to do so from the Referee. Otherwise, he must be replaced by the substitute goalkeeper immediately (without any delay) or be assessed a bench minor penalty for delay of game.

**27.7 Participating in the Play Over the Center Red Line** - If a goalkeeper participates in the play in any manner (intentionally plays the puck or checks an opponent) when he is beyond the center red line, a minor penalty shall be imposed upon him. The position of the puck is the determining factor for the application of this rule.

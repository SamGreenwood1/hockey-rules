**15.1 Calling a Penalty** - Should an infraction of the rules which would call for a minor, major, misconduct, game misconduct or match penalty be committed by a player of the side in control of the puck, the Referee shall immediately blow his whistle and penalize the offending player.

Should an infraction of the rules which would call for a minor, major, misconduct, game misconduct or match penalty be committed by a player of the team not in control of the puck, the Referee shall raise his arm to signal the delayed calling of a penalty. When the team to be penalized gains control of the puck, the Referee will blow his whistle to stop play and impose the penalty on the offending player.

When a player, Trainer, Manager, coach or non-playing Club personnel is ejected from the game for a violation of the playing rules, that individual must vacate the players’ bench area and may not, in any manner, further participate in the game. This includes directing the team from the spectator area or by radio communications. Any violations shall be reported to the Commissioner.

Refer to Reference Tables – Table 1 – Summary of Penalties to Coaches and Non-playing Club Personnel (page 137) for a list of infractions specific to those individuals.

**15.2 Calling a Minor Penalty** – Goal Scored - If the penalty to be imposed is a minor penalty and a goal is scored on the play by the non-offending side, the minor penalty shall not be imposed but major and match penalties shall be imposed in the normal manner regardless of whether or not a goal is scored.

If two or more minor penalties were to be imposed and a goal is scored on the play by the non-offending side, the Captain of the offending team shall designate to the Referee which minor penalty(ies) will be assessed and which minor penalty will be washed out as a result of the scoring of the goal.

**15.3 Calling a Double-minor Penalty** – Goal Scored - When the penalty to be imposed is applicable under Rule 47 for Head-butting or Rule 58 Butt-ending, Rule 60 High-sticking or Rule 62 Spearing, and a goal is scored, two minutes of the appropriate penalty will be assessed to the offending player. (This will be announced as a double-minor for the appropriate infraction and the player will serve two (2) minutes only.)

**15.4 Calling a Penalty** – Short-handed Team – Goal Scored - If when a team is “short-handed” by reason of one or more minor or bench minor penalties, and the Referee signals a further minor penalty or penalties against the “short-handed” team and a goal is scored by the non-offending side before the whistle is blown, then the goal shall be allowed. The penalty or penalties signaled shall be assessed and the first of the minor penalties already being served shall automatically terminate under Rule 16 – Minor 

Penalties. Major and match penalties shall be imposed in the normal manner regardless of whether or not a goal is scored.

Should a minor or bench minor penalty be signaled against a team already short-handed by reason of a major (or match) penalty, but efore the play can be stopped to assess the minor or bench minor penalty, and a goal is scored by the non-offending side, the signaled minor or bench minor penalty shall not be imposed due to the scoring of the goal.

Should a penalty be signaled against a team already short-handed by reason of one or more minor or bench minor penalties, and the signaled penalty would result in the awarding of a penalty shot, but before the Referee can stop play to award the penalty shot, the nonoffending team scores a goal, then the signaled penalty (that would have resulted in a penalty shot) shall be assessed as a minor (doubleminor, major or match) penalty and the first of the minor penalties
already being served shall automatically terminate under Rule 16 – Minor Penalties.

**15.5 Face-off Locations** – When players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in one or more penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one team, the ensuing face-off shall be conducted at one of the two face-off spots in the offending team’s end zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application:
	*(i) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – face-off at center ice;.*
	*(ii) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – face-off at center ice;*
	*(iii) when the defending team is penalized and the attacking players enter the attacking zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone face-off circle –	face-off in the neutral zone (see Rule 76.2, paragraph 10);*

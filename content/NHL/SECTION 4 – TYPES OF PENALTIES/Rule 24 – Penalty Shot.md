**24.1 Penalty Shot** – A penalty shot is designed to restore a scoring opportunity which was lost as a result of an infraction being committed by the offending team, based on the parameters set out in these rules.

**24.2 Procedure** - The Referee shall have announced over the public address system the player designated by him or selected by the team entitled to take the shot (as appropriate). He shall then place the puck on the center face-off spot and the player taking the shot will, on the instruction of the Referee (by blowing his whistle), play the puck from there and shall attempt to score on the goalkeeper. The puck must be kept in motion towards the opponent’s goal line and once it is shot, the play shall be considered complete. No goal can be scored on a rebound of any kind (an exception being the puck off the goal post or crossbar, then the goalkeeper and then directly into the goal), and any time the puck crosses the goal line or comes to a complete stop, the shot shall be considered complete.

The lacrosse-like move whereby the puck is picked up on the blade of the stick and “whipped” into the net shall be permitted provided the puck is not raised above the height of the shoulders at any time and when released, is not carried higher than the crossbar. See also 80.1.

The spin-o-rama type move where the player completes a 360° turn as he approaches the goal, shall not be permitted. Should a player perform such a move during the shot, the shot shall be stopped by the Referee and no goal will be the result.

Only a player designated as a goalkeeper or alternate goalkeeper  may defend against a penalty shot.

The goalkeeper must remain in his crease until the player taking a penalty shot has touched the puck.

If at the time a penalty shot is awarded, the goalkeeper of the penalized team has been removed from the ice to substitute another player, the goalkeeper shall be permitted to return to the ice before the shot is taken.	

The team against whom the penalty shot has been assessed may replace their goalkeeper to defend against the shot, however, the substitute goalkeeper is required to remain in the game until the next stoppage of play.

While the penalty shot is being taken, players of both sides shall withdraw to the sides of the rink and in front of their own player’s bench.

**24.3 Designated Player** – In cases where a penalty shot has been awarded to a player specifically fouled, that player shall be designated by the Referee to take the shot.	

In all other cases where a penalty shot has been awarded, the shot shall be taken by a player selected by the Captain of the nonoffending team from the players on the ice at the time when the infraction was committed. Such selection shall be reported to the Referee and cannot be changed.

If by reason of injury, the player designated by the Referee to take a penalty shot is unable to do so within a reasonable time, the shot may be taken by a player selected by the Captain of the non-offending team from the players on the ice when the infraction was committed. Such selection shall be reported to the Referee and cannot be changed.

Should the player in respect to whom a penalty shot has been awarded commit an infraction in connection with the same play or circumstances, either before or after the shot has been awarded, he shall first be permitted to do so before being sent to the penalty bench to serve the penalty. Except when such penalty is for a game misconduct or match penalty in which case the shot shall be taken by a player selected by the Captain of the non-offending team from the players on the ice at the time when the infraction was committed.

**24.4 Violations During the Shot** – Should the goalkeeper leave his crease prior to the player taking the penalty shot touches the puck, or commits any infraction, the Referee shall allow the shot to be taken. If the shot fails, he shall permit the shot to be taken over again. When an infraction worthy of a minor penalty is committed by the goalkeeperduring the shot causing it to fail, no penalty is assessed but the Referee shall permit the shot to be taken over again. Should a goalkeeper commit a second violation and the shot fails, he shall be assessed a misconduct penalty and the Referee shall permit the shot to be taken over again. A third such violation shall result in the goalkeeper being assessed a game misconduct penalty and the Referee shall permit the shot to be taken over again, against the alternate goalkeeper.

When a major or match penalty is committed by the goalkeeper that causes the shot to fail, the Referee shall permit the shot to be taken over again and the appropriate penalties shall be assessed to the goalkeeper.	

The goalkeeper may attempt to stop the shot in any manner except by throwing his stick or any object, or by deliberately dislodging the goal, in which case a goal shall be awarded.

During the shot, should the goalkeeper, in an attempt at making a save, dislodge the goal accidentally, the Referee shall make one of the following determinations:
	(i) Award a goal if he deems the player would have scored into the area normally occupied by the net had it not been dislodged.
	(ii) Allow the shot to be re-taken if he does not score or it could not be determined if the puck would have entered the area normally occupied by the net.
	(iii) If the goal becomes dislodged after the puck has crossed the goal line thus ending the shot, the above determinations do not apply, the shot is complete.

If, while a penalty shot is being taken, any player, Coach or nonplaying Club personnel of the opposing team interferes with or distracts the player taking the shot and, because of such action, the shot fails, a second attempt shall be permitted. The Referee shall impose a bench minor penalty to the offending team, and if a player on the bench is responsible, a misconduct penalty on the player responsible shall be assessed. When a Coach or non-playing Club personnel is guilty of such an act, he shall be automatically suspended from the game, ordered to the dressing room and the matter will be reported to the Commissioner for possible further disciplinary action.	

If, while the penalty shot is being taken, any player, goalkeeper, Coach or non-playing Club personnel of the team taking the shot interferes with or distracts the goalkeeper defending the shot and, because of such action, the shot is successful, the Referee shall rule no goal and shall impose a bench minor penalty to the offending team. If a player or goalkeeper on the bench is responsible, a misconduct penalty on the player or goalkeeper responsible shall be assessed. When a Coach or non-playing Club personnel is guilty of such an act, he shall be automatically suspended from the game, ordered to the dressing room and the matter will be reported to the Commissioner for possible further disciplinary action.

If while the penalty shot is being taken a spectator throws any object onto the ice that in the judgment of the Referee interferes with the player taking the shot or the goalkeeper defending the shot, he shall permit the shot be taken again.

If, after a player’s stick has been ruled illegal, he attempts to take a penalty shot with a second stick that is also ruled illegal prior to taking the shot, the opportunity to take the shot shall be disallowed. The player shall be assessed one minor penalty for the first illegal stick

**24.5 Face-Off Location** - If a goal is scored from a penalty shot, the puck shall be faced-off at center ice. If a goal is not scored, the puck shall be faced-off at either of the end face-off spots in the zone in which the penalty shot was attempted, except when another rule dictates the face-off location should be in an alternate location, such as when the point men enter the zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone faceoff circle or when the attacking team has been penalized on the same play (see Rule 76.2).

**24.6 Results** - Should a goal be scored from a penalty shot, a further penalty to the offending player or goalkeeper shall not be applied unless the offense for which the penalty shot was awarded is a major, match or misconduct penalty, in which case the appropriate penalty shall be imposed.	

If the offense for which the penalty shot was awarded would normally incur a minor penalty, then regardless of the outcome of the shot, no further minor penalty shall be served.

If the offense for which the penalty shot was awarded was to incur a double-minor penalty, or where the offending team is assessed an additional minor penalty on the same play, the first minor penalty is not assessed since the penalty shot was awarded to restore the lost scoring opportunity. The second minor penalty would be assessed and served regardless of whether the penalty shot results in a goal. This will be announced as a double-minor penalty for the appropriate infraction and the player will serve two (2) minutes only. No penalty shall expire when a goal is scored against a team on a penalty shot.	

Should two penalty shots be awarded to the same team at the same stoppage of play (two separate infractions), only one goal can be scored or awarded at a single stoppage of play. Should the first penalty shot result in a goal, the second shot would not be taken but the appropriate penalty would be assessed and served as normal.

**24.7 Timing** - If the infraction upon which the penalty shot is based occurs during actual playing time, the penalty shot shall be awarded and taken immediately in the usual manner notwithstanding any delay occasioned by a slow whistle by the Referee to allow play to continue until the attacking side has lost possession of the puck to the defending side, which delay results in the expiry of the regular playing time in any period. 

The time required for the taking of a penalty shot shall not be included in the regular playing time or overtime.

**24.8 Infractions** – Refer to the Reference Tables – Table 11 – Summary of Penalty Shots (page 143) for a list of the infractions that shall result in a penalty shot being awarded (see specific rule numbers for complete descriptions).

There are four (4) specific conditions that must be met in order for the Referee to award a penalty shot for a player being fouled from behind. They are:
	(i) The infraction must have taken place in the neutral zone or attacking zone, (i.e. over the puck carrier’s own blue line);
	(ii) The infraction must have been committed from behind;
	(iii) The player in possession and control (or, in the judgment of the Referee, clearly would have obtained possession and control of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score (the fact that he got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the penalty shot consideration criteria. If the infraction was from behind and he was denied a “more” reasonable scoring opportunity due to the infraction, then the penalty shot should be awarded);
	(iv) The player in possession and control (or, in the judgment of the Referee, clearly would have obtained possession and control of the puck) must have had no opposing player between himself and the goalkeeper.

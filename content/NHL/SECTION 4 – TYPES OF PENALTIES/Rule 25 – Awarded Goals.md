**25.1 Awarded Goal** – A goal will be awarded to the attacking team when the opposing team has taken their goalkeeper off the ice and an attacking player has possession and control of the puck (or would have gained possession and control) in the neutral or attacking zone, without a defending player between himself and the opposing goal, and he is prevented from scoring as a result of an infraction committed by the defending team (see 25.3 Infractions – When Goalkeeper is Off the Ice, below). 

**25.2 Infractions – When Goalkeeper is On the Ice** – A goal will be awarded when an attacking player, with an imminent scoring opportunity, is prevented from scoring as a result of a defending player or goalkeeper displacing the goal post, either deliberately or accidentally. 

**25.3 Infractions – When Goalkeeper is Off the Ice** – Refer to the Reference Tables – Table 12 – Summary of Awarded Goals (When Goalkeeper has been Removed for an Extra Attacker) (page 143) for a list of the infractions that shall result in an awarded goal when the goalkeeper has been removed for an extra attacker (see specific rule numbers for complete descriptions). 

**25.4 Infractions – During the Course of a Penalty Shot** - A goal will be awarded when a goalkeeper attempts to stop a penalty shot by throwing his stick or any other object at the player taking the shot or by dislodging the goal (either deliberately or accidentally) (see Rule 63.7).

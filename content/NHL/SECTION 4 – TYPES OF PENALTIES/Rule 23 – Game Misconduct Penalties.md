**23.1 Game Misconduct Penalty** - A game misconduct penalty involves the suspension of a player for the balance of the game but a substitute is permitted to replace the player removed. Ten minutes are applied in the league records to the player incurring a game misconduct penalty.

**23.2 Fines and Suspensions** - A player incurring a game misconduct penalty shall be reported to the Commissioner who shall have full power to impose such further penalties by way of suspension or fine on the penalized player or any other player involved in the altercation.

Any game misconduct penalty for which a player has been assessed an automatic suspension or supplementary discipline in the form of game suspension(s) by the Commissioner shall not be taken into account when calculating the total number of offenses under this subsection.	

The automatic suspensions incurred under this subsection in respect to League games shall have no effect with respect to violations during Playoff games. 
Any request by a Club to have a game misconduct reviewed and rescinded by the League must submit their request in writing to the Hockey Operations Department within 48 hours of the conclusion of the game in which the game misconduct was assessed. Failure to submit the written request within this time frame will automatically result in the game misconduct being upheld and no further review of the incident will be considered or entertained. This does not apply to infractions addressed under Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline. 

**23.3 Fines and Suspensions** – General Category - In regular League games, any player who incurs a total of three (3) game misconduct penalties in the “General Category” and exclusive of other designated categories, shall be suspended for the next League game of his team. For each subsequent game misconduct penalty, the automatic suspension shall be increased by one game. For each suspension of a player or goalkeeper, his Club shall be fined one thousand dollars ($1,000).

In Playoff games, any player who incurs a total of two game misconduct penalties in the “General Category” shall be suspended automatically for the next Playoff game of his team. For each subsequent game misconduct penalty during the Playoffs, the automatic suspension shall be increased by one game. For each suspension of a player during Playoffs, his club shall be fined one thousand dollars ($1,000).

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1 Rink&lt;/strong&gt; - National Hockey League games shall be played on an ice surface known as the “Rink” and must adhere to the dimensions and specifications prescribed by the League and these rules. No ice markings shall be permitted except those provided for under these rules unless express written permission has been obtained from the League. On-ice logos must not interfere with any official ice markings provided for the proper playing of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interval between periods, the ice surface shall be flooded unless mutually agreed to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.2 Dimensions&lt;/strong&gt; - The official size of the rink shall be two hundred feet (200&amp;rsquo;) long and eighty-five feet (85&amp;rsquo;) wide. The corners shall be rounded in the arc of a circle with a radius of twenty-eight feet (28&amp;rsquo;). See diagram on page iv preceding the table of contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3 Boards and Glass&lt;/strong&gt; - The rink shall be surrounded by a wall known as the “boards” which shall extend not less than forty inches (40&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) and not more than forty-eight inches (48&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) above the level of the ice surface. The ideal height of the boards above the ice surface shall be forty-two inches (42&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;). Except for the official markings provided for in these rules, the entire playing surface and the boards shall be white in color except the kick plate at the bottom of the boards, which shall be light yellow in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any variations from any of the foregoing dimensions shall require official authorization by the League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boards shall be constructed in such a manner that the surface facing the ice shall be smooth and free of any obstruction or any object that could cause injury to players.
Affixed to the boards and extending vertically shall be approved safety glass extending eight feet (8’) above the boards at each end of the rink and not less than five feet (5’) along both sides of the rink. Protective glass shall be required in front of the penalty benches. The glass and gear to hold them in position shall be properly padded or protected and mounted on the boards on the side away from the playing surface including the spectator netting outlined in Rule 1.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.4 Spectator Netting&lt;/strong&gt; – Spectator netting shall be hung in the ends of the arena, of a height, type, and in a manner approved by the League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5 Lines&lt;/strong&gt; - Eleven feet (11&amp;rsquo;) from each end of the rink and in the center of a red line two inches (2&amp;quot;) wide drawn completely across the width of the ice and continued vertically up the side of the boards, regulation goal posts and nets shall be set in such a manner as to remain stationary during the progress of a game. The red line, two inches (2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) wide, between the goal posts on the ice and extended completely across the rink, shall be known as the “GOAL LINE.” In front of each goal, a “GOAL CREASE” area shall be marked by a red line two inches (2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in width. The ice surface between the goals shall be divided into three zones by lines, twelve inches (12&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in width, and blue in color, drawn sixty-four feet (64&amp;rsquo;) out from the goal lines, and extended completely across the rink, parallel with the goal lines, and continued vertically up the side of the boards. (Paint code PMS 286.) Another line, twelve inches (12&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in width and red in color, drawn completely across the rink in center ice, parallel with the goal lines and continued vertically up the side of the boards, known as the “CENTER LINE.” This line shall contain regular interval markings of a uniform distinctive design, which will readily distinguish it from the two blue lines, the outer edges of which must be continuous. (Paint code PMS 186.)
&lt;strong&gt;1.6 Division of Ice Surface&lt;/strong&gt; - That portion of the ice surface in which the goal is situated shall be called the “DEFENDING ZONE” of the Team defending that goal; the central portion shall be known as the “NEUTRAL ZONE,” and the portion farthest from the defended goal as the “ATTACKING ZONE.”
&lt;strong&gt;1.7 Goal Crease / Referee Crease&lt;/strong&gt; - The goal crease shall be laid out as follows: One foot (1&amp;rsquo;) outside of each goal post a two-inch (2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) line shall be painted extending four feet, six inches (4&#39;6&amp;quot;) in length. These lines shall be at right angles to the goal line. A semi-circle line six feet (6&amp;rsquo;) in radius and two inches (2&amp;quot;) in width shall be drawn using the center of the goal line as the center point and connecting both ends of the side of the crease. On the side of the crease lines, four feet (4&amp;rsquo;) from the goal line, extend a five-inch (5&amp;quot;) line into the crease. (see diagram on page iv preceding the table of contents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal crease area shall include all the space outlined by the crease lines and extending vertically four feet (4&amp;rsquo;) to the level of the top of the goal frame. The area outlined by the crease line and the goal line shall be painted a light blue color. (Paint code PMS 298.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area inside the goal frame to the goal line shall be painted a gloss white color.
On the ice immediately in front of the Penalty Timekeeper’s seat there shall be marked in red on the ice a semi-circle of ten foot (10&amp;rsquo;) radius and two inches (2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in width which shall be known as the “REFEREE’S CREASE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.8 Goalkeeper’s Restricted Area&lt;/strong&gt; - A restricted trapezoid-shaped area behind the goal will be laid out as follows: Seven feet (7&amp;rsquo;) outside of each goal crease (eight feet (8&amp;rsquo;) from each goal post), a two-inch (2&amp;quot;) red line shall be painted extending from the goal line to a point on the end of the rink ten feet (10&amp;rsquo;) from the goal crease (eleven feet (11&amp;rsquo;) from the goal post) and continuing vertically up the kick plate (see diagram on the page iv preceding the table of contents). (Paint code PMS 186).
&lt;strong&gt;1.9 Face-off Spots and Circles&lt;/strong&gt; - A circular blue spot, twelve inches (12&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in diameter, shall be marked exactly in the center of the rink; and with this spot as a center, a circle of fifteen feet (15&amp;rsquo;) radius shall be marked with a blue line two inches (2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two red spots two feet (2&amp;rsquo;) in diameter shall be marked on the ice in the neutral zone five feet (5&amp;rsquo;) from each blue line. Within the face-off spot, draw two parallel lines three inches (3&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) from the top and bottom of the spot. The area within the two lines shall be painted red, the remainder shall be painted white. The spots shall be forty-four feet (44&amp;rsquo;) apart and each shall be a uniform distance from the adjacent boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circles shall be two inches (2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) wide with a radius of fifteen feet (15&amp;rsquo;) from the center of the face-off spots. At the outer edge of both sides of each face-off circle and parallel to the goal line shall be marked two red lines, two inches (2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) wide and two feet (2&amp;rsquo;) in length and five feet seven inches (5&#39;7”) apart. One foot away from the outer edge of the face-off spot, two lines shall be drawn parallel with the side boards that shall be four feet (4&amp;rsquo;)in length and eighteen inches (18&amp;quot;) apart. Parallel to the end boards, commencing at the end of the line nearest to the face-off spot, a line shall extend two feet ten inches (2&#39;10&amp;quot;) in length. All lines shall be two inches (2&amp;quot;) in width. See diagram on page v preceding the table of contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location of the face-off spots shall be fixed in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along a line twenty feet (20&amp;rsquo;) from each goal line and parallel to it, mark two points twenty-two feet (22&amp;rsquo;) on both sides of the straight line joining the center of the two goals. Each such point shall be the center of a face-off spot and circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.10 Ice Cleaning&lt;/strong&gt; - Aside from the normal ice resurfacing that is performed during the intermissions between each period of play, the following snow removal activities shall be performed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*(i) During each commercial time-out, the ice cleaning crew shall remove snow from the goal crease area, in front of the players’ and penalty benches and from side to side from the top of the circles to the end boards (ideally, the entire end zone from the blue lines in).*
*(ii) During the regular season, at the end of the third period in a tied game and prior to the commencement of the five minute overtime period, the entire ice surface shall be shoveled by arena personnel utilizing the same procedures as are utilized during TV time-outs.*
*(iii) During the regular season, at the end of the five minute overtime period in a tied game and prior to the commencement of the shootout, the entire ice surface shall be shoveled by arena personnel utilizing the same procedures as are utilized during TV time-outs.* 
*(iv) During overtime in the playoffs, the procedure outlined in (i) above will take place at the first stoppage of play at or following the 10:00 mark of the period. This will occur regardless as to whether or not an icing has occurred or a penalty for either team is in effect.*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific and technical guidelines for the above procedures are available from the NHL Hockey Operations Department and are distributed when updated to the arena managers as required.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.1 Player’s Stick&lt;/strong&gt; – (see 10.2 for goalkeeper) The sticks shall be made of wood or other material approved by the League, and must not have any projections. Adhesive tape of any color may be wrapped around the stick at any place for the purpose of reinforcement or to improve control of the puck.
No stick shall exceed sixty-three inches (63&amp;quot;) in length from theheel to the end of the shaft nor more than twelve and one-half inches (121/2&amp;quot;) from the heel to the end of the blade.
Requests for an exception to the length of the shaft (only) may be submitted in writing to and must be approved by the Hockey Operations Department prior to any such stick being used. Only players 6’6” tall or more will be considered for exception. Maximum length of a stick granted an exception under this rule is sixty-five inches (65”).
The blade of the stick shall not be more than three inches (3&amp;quot;) in width at any point between the heel and ½” in from the mid-point of the tip of the blade, nor less than two inches (2&amp;quot;). All edges of the blade shall be beveled (see 9.8). The curvature of the blade of the stick shall be restricted in such a way that the distance of a perpendicular line measured from a straight line drawn from any point at the heel to the end of the blade to the point of maximum curvature shall not exceed three-quarters of an inch (3/4&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![[Pasted image 20240209091247.png]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.2 Goalkeeper’s Stick&lt;/strong&gt; - In the case of a goalkeeper’s stick, there shall be a knob of white tape or other protective material approved by the League. This knob must not be less than one-half inch (1/2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) thick at the top of the shaft.
Failure to comply with this provision of the rule will result in the goalkeeper’s stick being deemed unfit for play. The goalkeeper’s stick must be changed without the assessment of a minor penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blade of the goalkeeper’s stick shall not exceed three and one-half inches (31/2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in width at any point except at the heel, where it must not exceed four and one-half inches (41/2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in width; nor shall the goalkeeper’s stick exceed fifteen and one-half inches (151/2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in length from the heel to the end of the blade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is to be no measurement of any goalkeeper’s stick during the course of the game. The League’s Hockey Operations Department is specifically authorized to make a check of all goalkeepers’ sticks to ensure the compliance with the rule. It shall report its findings to the Commissioner for his disciplinary action (see 11.9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widened portion of the goalkeeper’s stick extending up the shaft from the blade shall not extend more than twenty-six inches (26&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) from the heel and shall not exceed three and one-half inches (31/2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![[Pasted image 20240209091504.png]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requests for an exemption to the length of the paddle (only) may be submitted in writing to and must be approved by the Hockey Operations Department prior to any stick being approved. Only players 6’6” tall or more will be considered for exemption. Maximum length of a stick paddle granted an exception under this rule is twentysix inches (26”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.3 Broken Stick&lt;/strong&gt; – Player - A broken stick is one which, in the opinion of the Referee, is unfit for normal play.
A player without a stick may participate in the game.
A player whose stick is broken may participate in the game provided he drops the broken stick. A minor penalty shall be imposed for an infraction of this rule.
A player who has lost or broken his stick may receive a replacement stick by having one handed to him from his own players’ bench, by having one handed to him by a teammate on the ice or by picking up his own unbroken stick or that of a teammate from the ice. A player will be penalized if he throws or shoots a stick to a teammate on the ice, or if he picks up and plays with an opponent’s stick. A player may not participate in the play using a goalkeeper’s stick. A minor penalty shall be imposed for an infraction of this rule.
A player using a stick thrown on the ice from the players’ or penalty bench will not receive a penalty. However, the person responsible for throwing the stick will receive a bench minor penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.4 Broken Stick&lt;/strong&gt; – Goalkeeper - A goalkeeper may continue to play with a broken stick until a stoppage of play or until he has one legally provided to him by a teammate. The teammate cannot throw or shoot it to the goalkeeper (this includes situations where the goalkeeper has lost his stick and a teammate is trying to return it to him). For a violation of this rule, a minor penalty for throwing the stick shall be assessed to the offending player (no penalty to the goalkeeper for receiving the stick).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A goalkeeper whose stick is broken or illegal may not go to the
players’ bench for a replacement but must receive his stick from a
teammate. A goalkeeper may participate in the play using a skater’s
stick until such time as he is legally provided with a replacement
goalkeeper’s stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an infraction of this rule, a minor penalty shall be imposed on the goalkeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.5 Stick Measurement&lt;/strong&gt; - A request for a stick measurement shall be limited to one request per team during the course of any stoppage in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a formal complaint is made by the Captain or Alternate Captain of a team, against the dimensions of an opponent’s stick, that opponent must be on the ice at the time the request is made to the Referee. Once the request is made, and as long as the Officials maintain visual contact with the stick, it can be measured. This means hat if the player whose stick is about to be measured steps off the ice onto his players’ bench, his stick may still be measured provided the request was received prior to him leaving the ice surface and the stick remains in the view of at least one of the on-ice Officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Referee shall take the stick to the penalty bench where the necessary measurement shall be made immediately. Players on both teams shall retire to their respective benches. To measure the curvature of the blade of the stick, the Referee must draw an imaginary line along the outside of the shaft to the bottom of the blade and then along the bottom of the blade - this will determine the location of the heel. Using a League-approved measuring gauge, the Referee shall secure the gauge at the heel of the stick and measure the curvature of the blade from the heel to \ any point along the toe of the blade. To measure any other dimension of the stick, the Referee shall use a measuring tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result shall be reported to the Penalty Timekeeper, who shall record it on the back of the Penalty Record form. The Referee will convey the result of the measurement to the Captain or Alternate Captain of the team whose stick was measured. If the stick proves to be illegal, the stick shall remain at the penalty bench until the end of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A player whose stick has been measured and it is found not to conform to the rule shall be assessed a minor penalty and a fine of two hundred dollars ($200). For a second offense in the same season, the player shall (in addition to the minor penalty) be fined one thousand dollars ($1000). For a third offense in the same season, the player shall (in addition to the minor penalty) be assessed a game misconduct and an automatic one game suspension. For all additional violations in the same season, the automatic suspension to the player shall (in addition to the minor penalty and game misconduct assessed during the game) double for each subsequent violation of this rule (i.e. first suspension - one game, second suspension - two games, third suspension – four games etc.) If the complaint is not sustained, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed against the complaining Club.
A player who participates in the play (i.e. checks or prevents the movement of an opponent or who plays the puck) while carrying two sticks (including while taking a replacement stick to his goalkeeper) shall incur a minor penalty under this rule. The automatic fine of two hundred dollars ($200) shall not be imposed. If this participation causes an infraction resulting in a penalty, the Referee shall report the incident to the Commissioner for disciplinary action.
A request for a stick measurement in regular playing time is permitted, including after the scoring of a goal, however, a goal cannot be disallowed as a result of the measurement. A request for a stick measurement following a goal in overtime (including one scored on a penalty shot in overtime) is not permitted. Stick measurements prior to or during the shootout are permitted, subject to the guidelines outlined in 10.7.
Any player who deliberately breaks his stick or who refuses to surrender his stick for measurement when requested to do so by the Referee shall be assessed a minor penalty plus a ten-minute (10) misconduct. In addition, this player or goalkeeper shall be subject to a two hundred dollar ($200) fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.6 Stick Measurement&lt;/strong&gt; – Prior to Penalty Shot – A stick measurement request may be made prior to a penalty shot following these guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Stick
If the stick is “legal” the complaining Club is assessed a bench minor penalty, and a player is placed in the penalty box immediately. Regardless as to the result of the shot, the bench minor penalty is assessed and served.
If the stick is “illegal” the player will be assessed a minor penalty. He will be ordered to obtain a new (second) stick prior to the shot. After he takes the shot he will be required to serve his penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second stick
The player will be told that the second stick will be measured prior to the shot to verify the legality of the stick.
If the second stick is “legal”, proceed with the shot.
If second stick is “illegal”, disallow the opportunity for the shot and assess one minor penalty for the first illegal stick.
If the player refuses to surrender his stick for measurement, the shot shall not be permitted and the player shall be assessed a misconduct penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.7 Stick Measurement&lt;/strong&gt; – Prior to Shootout Attempt – A stick measurement request must be made prior to the Referee blowing his whistle to begin the shootout attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stick is “legal” the complaining Club forfeits their next shootout attempt. In addition, the complaining Club’s Coach shall be fined one thousand dollars ($1000) and the Club shall be fined five thousand dollars ($5000). Their next shootout attempt would be recorded as “no goal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stick is “illegal”, the offending team forfeits that shootout attempt by that player, and the player becomes ineligible to participate in the shootout. In addition, the player is fined one thousand dollars ($1000) and his Club is fined five thousand dollars ($5000). This
shootout attempt would be recorded as “no goal”.
Stick measurement violations during the shootout shall not be
subject to the fines and suspensions outlined in 10.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.8 Illegal Stick&lt;/strong&gt; – An illegal stick is defined as one that, following a measurement, is deemed not conforming to league rules. An illegal stick is also defined as one when a player has not been legally handed one by his players’ bench or from a teammate. And finally, an illegal stick is anytime a player on the ice attempts to play the game with an opponent’s stick.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/nhl/section-4--types-of-penalties/rule-15--calling-of-penalties/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15.1 Calling a Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; - Should an infraction of the rules which would call for a minor, major, misconduct, game misconduct or match penalty be committed by a player of the side in control of the puck, the Referee shall immediately blow his whistle and penalize the offending player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should an infraction of the rules which would call for a minor, major, misconduct, game misconduct or match penalty be committed by a player of the team not in control of the puck, the Referee shall raise his arm to signal the delayed calling of a penalty. When the team to be penalized gains control of the puck, the Referee will blow his whistle to stop play and impose the penalty on the offending player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a player, Trainer, Manager, coach or non-playing Club personnel is ejected from the game for a violation of the playing rules, that individual must vacate the players’ bench area and may not, in any manner, further participate in the game. This includes directing the team from the spectator area or by radio communications. Any violations shall be reported to the Commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to Reference Tables – Table 1 – Summary of Penalties to Coaches and Non-playing Club Personnel (page 137) for a list of infractions specific to those individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15.2 Calling a Minor Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; – Goal Scored - If the penalty to be imposed is a minor penalty and a goal is scored on the play by the non-offending side, the minor penalty shall not be imposed but major and match penalties shall be imposed in the normal manner regardless of whether or not a goal is scored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If two or more minor penalties were to be imposed and a goal is scored on the play by the non-offending side, the Captain of the offending team shall designate to the Referee which minor penalty(ies) will be assessed and which minor penalty will be washed out as a result of the scoring of the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15.3 Calling a Double-minor Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; – Goal Scored - When the penalty to be imposed is applicable under Rule 47 for Head-butting or Rule 58 Butt-ending, Rule 60 High-sticking or Rule 62 Spearing, and a goal is scored, two minutes of the appropriate penalty will be assessed to the offending player. (This will be announced as a double-minor for the appropriate infraction and the player will serve two (2) minutes only.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15.4 Calling a Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; – Short-handed Team – Goal Scored - If when a team is “short-handed” by reason of one or more minor or bench minor penalties, and the Referee signals a further minor penalty or penalties against the “short-handed” team and a goal is scored by the non-offending side before the whistle is blown, then the goal shall be allowed. The penalty or penalties signaled shall be assessed and the first of the minor penalties already being served shall automatically terminate under Rule 16 – Minor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penalties. Major and match penalties shall be imposed in the normal manner regardless of whether or not a goal is scored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should a minor or bench minor penalty be signaled against a team already short-handed by reason of a major (or match) penalty, but efore the play can be stopped to assess the minor or bench minor penalty, and a goal is scored by the non-offending side, the signaled minor or bench minor penalty shall not be imposed due to the scoring of the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should a penalty be signaled against a team already short-handed by reason of one or more minor or bench minor penalties, and the signaled penalty would result in the awarding of a penalty shot, but before the Referee can stop play to award the penalty shot, the nonoffending team scores a goal, then the signaled penalty (that would have resulted in a penalty shot) shall be assessed as a minor (doubleminor, major or match) penalty and the first of the minor penalties
already being served shall automatically terminate under Rule 16 – Minor Penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15.5 Face-off Locations&lt;/strong&gt; – When players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in one or more penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one team, the ensuing face-off shall be conducted at one of the two face-off spots in the offending team’s end zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application:
&lt;em&gt;(i) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – face-off at center ice;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(ii) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – face-off at center ice;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(iii) when the defending team is penalized and the attacking players enter the attacking zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone face-off circle –	face-off in the neutral zone (see Rule 76.2, paragraph 10);&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16.1 Minor Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; - For a minor penalty, any player, other than a goalkeeper, shall be ruled off the ice for two (2) minutes during which time no substitute shall be permitted. 16.2 Short-handed - “Short-handed” means that the team is below the numerical strength of its opponent on the ice at the time the goal is scored. The minor or bench minor penalty which terminates automatically is the one with the least amount of time on the clock. Thus coincident minor penalties to both Teams do not cause either side to be “short-handed” (see Rule 19 – Coincidental Penalties).
If while a team is “short-handed” by one or more minor or bench minor penalties, the opposing team scores a goal, the first of such penalties shall automatically terminate.
This rule shall also apply when a goal is awarded.
This rule does not apply when a goal is scored on a penalty shot (i.e. offending team’s penalized player(s) do not get released on the scoring of a goal on a penalty shot).
&lt;strong&gt;Minor penalty expiration criteria:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(i) Is the team scored against short-handed?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(ii) Is the team scored against serving a minor penalty on the clock?&lt;/em&gt;
If both criteria are satisfied, the minor penalty with the least amount of time on the clock shall terminate except when coincidental penalties are being served. Refer to Reference Tables – Table 14 – Goals Scored Against a Short-handed Team (page 144).
No penalty shall expire when a goal is scored against a team on a penalty shot.
When the minor penalties of two players of the same team terminate at the same time, the Captain of that team shall designate to the Referee which of such players will return to the ice first and the Referee will instruct the Penalty Timekeeper accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16.3 Infractions&lt;/strong&gt; – Refer to Reference Tables – Table 2 – Summary of Minor Penalties (page 137), for a list of infractions that can result in a minor penalty being assessed (see specific rule numbers for complete descriptions).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17.1 Bench Minor Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; - A bench minor penalty involves the removal from the ice of one player of the team against which the penalty is assessed for a period of two (2) minutes. Any player except a goalkeeper of the team may be designated to serve the penalty by the Coach through the playing Captain and such player shall take his place on the penalty bench promptly and serve the penalty as if it was a minor penalty imposed upon him.
&lt;strong&gt;17.2 Short-handed&lt;/strong&gt; – see 16.2.
&lt;strong&gt;17.3 Infractions&lt;/strong&gt; – Refer to Reference Tables – Table 3 – Summary of Bench Minor Penalties (page 138) for a list of infractions that can result in a bench minor penalty being assessed (see specific rule numbers for complete descriptions).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18.1 Double-minor Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; - For a double-minor penalty, any player, other than a goalkeeper, shall be ruled off the ice for four (4) minutes during which time no substitute shall be permitted.
&lt;strong&gt;18.2 Short-handed&lt;/strong&gt; – see 16.2.
When a double-minor penalty has been signaled by the Referee and the non-offending team scores during the delay, one of the minor penalties shall be washed out and the penalized player will serve the remaining two minutes of the double-minor penalty. The penalty will be announced as a double-minor penalty but only two minutes would be shown on the penalty time clock.
&lt;strong&gt;18.3 Infractions&lt;/strong&gt; – Refer to Reference Tables – Table 4 – Summary of Double-minor Penalties (page 139) for a list of infractions that can result in a double-minor penalty being assessed (see specific rule numbers for complete descriptions).&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/nhl/section-4--types-of-penalties/rule-19--coincidental-penalties/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19.1 Coincidental Minor Penalties&lt;/strong&gt; - When coincidental minor penalties or coincidental minor penalties of equal duration are imposed against players of both teams, the penalized players shall all take their places on the penalty benches and such penalized players shall not leave the penalty bench until the first stoppage of play following the expiry of their respective penalties. Where goalkeepers are involved, refer to 27.1. Immediate substitution shall be made for an equal number of minor penalties or coincidental minor penalties of equal duration to each team so penalized and the penalties of the players for which substitutions have been made shall not be taken into account for the purpose of the delayed penalty rule (Rule 26 – Delayed Penalties). This rule only applies when at least one team is already serving a time penalty in the penalty box that causes them to be short-handed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one minor penalty is assessed to one player of each team at the same stoppage in play, these penalties will be served without substitution provided there are no other penalties in effect and visible on the penalty clocks. Both teams will therefore play four skaters against four skaters for the duration of the minor penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should one or both of these players (or any other players) also incur a misconduct penalty in addition to their one minor penalty, this rule shall apply and the teams would still play four skaters against four skaters (the player incurring the misconduct penalty would have to serve the entire 12 minutes – minor plus misconduct – and his team would have to place an additional player on the penalty bench to serve the minor penalty and be able to return to the ice when the minor penalty expires).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When multiple penalties are assessed to both teams, equal numbers of minor and major penalties shall be eliminated using the coincidental penalty rule and any differential in time penalties shall be served in the normal manner and displayed on the penalty time clock accordingly (see 19.5). If there is no differential in time penalties, all players will serve their allotted penalty time, but will not be released until the first stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For coincidental penalties that carry over into, or are assessed during regular-season overtime, refer to 84.3, to Reference Tables – Table 17 – Penalties In Effect Prior to the Start of Overtime – Regular Season on page 160, and to Reference Tables – Table 18 – Penalties Assessed in Overtime – Regular Season on page 161.
&lt;strong&gt;19.2 Coincidental Major Penalties&lt;/strong&gt; - When coincidental major penalties or coincidental penalties of equal duration, including a major and/or a match penalty, are imposed against players of both teams, the penalized players shall all take their places on the penalty benches and such penalized players shall not leave the penalty benches until the first stoppage of play following the expiry of their respective penalties. Immediate substitutions shall be made for an equal number of major penalties, or coincidental penalties of equal duration including a major penalty to each team so penalized, and the penalties of the players for which substitutions have been made shall not be taken into account for the purpose of the delayed penalty rule, (Rule 26 – Delayed Penalties). In such situations, if one or both players have received a game misconduct in addition to their major penalties, no substitutes are required to take their places on the penalty benches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19.3 Coincidental Match Penalties&lt;/strong&gt; - When coincidental match penalties or coincidental penalties of equal duration, including a major and/or a match penalty, are imposed against players of both teams, the players with the match penalties shall be immediately removed from the game. The remaining penalized players shall not leave the penalty benches until the first stoppage of play following the expiry of their respective penalties. Immediate substitutions shall be made for an equal number of major and/or match penalties, or coincidental penalties of equal duration including a major or match penalty to each team so penalized, and the penalties of the players for which substitutions have been made shall not be taken into account for the purpose of the delayed penalty rule, (Rule 26 – Delayed Penalties).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19.4 Last Five Minutes and Overtime&lt;/strong&gt; - During the last five (5) minutes of regulation time, or at any time in overtime, when a minor penalty (or double-minor penalty) is assessed to one player of Team A, and a major (or match) penalty is assessed to one player of Team B at the same stoppage of play, the three-minute (or one-minute) differential shall be served immediately as a major penalty. This is also applicablewhen coincidental penalties are negated, leaving the aforementioned examples. In such instances, the team of the player receiving the major penalty must place the replacement player in the penalty bench prior to expiration of the penalty. In the case of a match penalty, the team must place the replacement player in the penalty bench immediately. The differential will be recorded on the penalty clock as a three (3) minute or a one (1) minute penalty (as applicable), and served in the same manner as a major penalty. This rule shall be applied regardless as to the on-ice strength of the two teams at the time the above outlined penalties are assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19.5 Applying the Coincidental Penalty Rule&lt;/strong&gt; – When multiple penalties are assessed to both teams at the same stoppage of play, the following rules are to be utilized by the Referees to determine the onice strength for both teams:
&lt;em&gt;(i) Cancel as many major and/or match penalties as possible&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(ii) Cancel as many minor, bench minor and or double-minor penalties as possible&lt;/em&gt;
Refer to Reference Tables - Table 15 – Coincidental Penalties on page 151.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1 Goal Posts&lt;/strong&gt; - The goal posts shall be kept in position by means of flexible pegs affixed in the ice or floor. The flexible pegs shall be ten inches (10&amp;quot;) in length and yellow in color.
The goal posts shall be of approved design and material, extending vertically four feet (4&amp;rsquo;) above the surface of the ice and set six feet (6&amp;rsquo;) apart measured from the inside of the posts. A crossbar of the same material as the goal posts shall extend from the top of one post to the top of the other. See diagram on page v preceding table of contents.
The goal posts and crossbar shall be painted in red and all other exterior surfaces shall be painted in white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2 Nets&lt;/strong&gt; - There shall be attached to each goal frame a net of approved design made of white nylon cord which shall be draped in such a manner as to prevent the puck coming to rest on the outside of it, yet strung in a manner that will keep the puck in the net.
A skirt of heavy white nylon fabric or heavyweight white canvas shall be laced around the base plate of the goal frame in such a way as to protect the net from being cut or broken. This protective padding must be attached in a manner that will not restrict the puck from completely crossing the goal line. This padding must be set back six inches (6&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) from the inside of the goal post. This skirt shall not project more than one inch (1&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) above the base plate.
The frame of the goal shall be draped with a nylon mesh net so as to completely enclose the back of the frame. The knotless nylon netting shall be made of heat set, resin treatment twine (0.197 inch (5 mm) diameter) or equivalent braided twine of multifilament white nylon with an appropriate break strength of 550 to 600 pounds (250-275 kilograms). The size of the mesh shall be two and one-half inches (2½&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) (inside measurement) from each knot to each diagonal knot when fully stretched. The net shall be laced to the frame with medium white nylon cord no smaller in size than No. 21.
The thin nylon mesh netting on the top of the goal frame shall be white 12 ply, four braid construction and 62 mm inside to inside mesh. This netting will be attached with 2.2 mm clear coated white twine of Dynemma braided construction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/nhl/section-4--types-of-penalties/rule-20--major-penalties/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20.1 Major Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; - For the first major penalty in any one game, the offender, except the goalkeeper, shall be ruled off the ice for five (5) minutes during which time no substitute shall be permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one player receives a major penalty and a minor penalty at the same time, the major penalty shall be served first by the penalized player (or substitute for the goalkeeper), except under Rule 19.2 where coincidental major penalties are in effect, in which case the minor penalty will be recorded and served first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20.2 Short-handed&lt;/strong&gt; – Although a major penalty does cause a team to be short-handed, the penalized player serving the major penalty does not leave the penalty bench when the opposing team scores. The player must wait for the entire major penalty to expire before he is permitted to exit the penalty bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20.3 Substitution&lt;/strong&gt; – When a player has been assessed a major penalty and has been removed from the game or is injured, the offending team does not have to place a substitute player on the penalty bench immediately, but must do so at a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of the major penalty. He may then legally exit the penalty bench&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the major penalty has expired. If the player has been assessed minor penalties in addition to the major penalty that must also be served on the penalty time clock, the offending team must place a substitute on the penalty bench immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to place a player on the penalty bench prior to the expiration of the major penalty will result in that team having to continue playing one player short (but not officially considered shorthanded) until the next stoppage of play. Any replacement player who enters the game other than from the penalty bench shall constitute an illegal substitution under Rule 68 – Illegal Substitution calling for a bench minor penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the team fails to place a player on the penalty bench to return to the ice at the end of the major penalty, they continued to play short-handed but are not permitted to ice the puck as they are no longer short-handed by reason of a penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20.4 Automatic Game Misconduct&lt;/strong&gt; – An automatic game misconduct shall be applied to any player who has been assessed a third major penalty in the same game.
An automatic game misconduct shall also be applicable whenever a player is assessed a major penalty for any of the infractions listed in the Reference Tables – Table 6 –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary of Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (page 139). See specific rule numbers for complete descriptions.
When a player has been assessed a major penalty for any of the infractions listed in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference Tables – Table 7 –  Summary of Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (page 140) and his opponent has suffered an injury to the face or head, a game misconduct must also be assessed. See specific rule numbers for complete descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a major and automatic game misconduct are assessed, the player shall be ruled off the ice for the balance of the game, but a substitute shall be permitted to replace the player so suspended after five (5) minutes have elapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20.5 Infractions&lt;/strong&gt; – Refer to the Reference Tables – Table 5 – Summary of Major Penalties (page 139) for a list of the infractions that can result in a major penalty being assessed (see specific rule numbers for\ complete descriptions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20.6 On-Ice Video Review of Major Penalties&lt;/strong&gt; – Referees shall review all plays that result in the assessment of any Major Penalty (other than a Major Penalty for Fighting) for the purpose of confirming (or modifying) their original call on the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such reviews will be conducted exclusively by the Referee(s) on the ice in consultation with other On-Ice Official(s), as appropriate, using the technology (for example, a handheld tablet or a television or computer monitor) specified in and provided pursuant to Rule 38.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication between the Situation Room and the On-Ice Officials shall be limited to contact between the appropriate Game Logger in the Situation Room and the Referee to ensure the Referee is receiving any and all video they might request, as well as the appropriate replay angles they may need to review the penalty call. There shall be no other contact or consultation between the On-Ice Official(s) and the NHL Situation Room, or with any other non-game participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Referee shall have the following options after video review of his own call: (i) confirming his original Major Penalty call; (ii) reducing his original Major Penalty call to a lesser penalty; or (iii) rescinding the original Major Penalty altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22.1 Misconduct Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; - In the event of misconduct penalties to any players except the goalkeeper, the players shall be ruled off the ice for a period of ten (10) minutes each. A substitute player is permitted to immediately replace a player serving a misconduct penalty.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22.2 Misconduct Penalty – Goalkeeper&lt;/strong&gt; - Should a goalkeeper on the ice incur a misconduct penalty, this penalty shall be served by another member of his team who was on the ice when the offense was committed.

Should the opposing team score during the time the minor penalty is being served, the minor penalty shall terminate (unless 15.4 is applicable) and the misconduct to the originally penalized player shall start immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a player receives a major penalty and a misconduct penalty at the same time, the penalized team shall place a substitute player on the penalty bench before the major penalty expires and no replacement for the penalized player shall be permitted to enter the game except from the penalty bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22.4 Reporting&lt;/strong&gt; – All misconduct penalties assessed for abuse of officials must be reported in detail to the League office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22.5 Infractions&lt;/strong&gt; – Refer to the Reference Tables – Table 9 – Summary of Misconduct Penalties (page 141) for a list of the infractions that can result in a misconduct penalty being assessed (see specific rule numbers for complete descriptions).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23.1 Game Misconduct Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; - A game misconduct penalty involves the suspension of a player for the balance of the game but a substitute is permitted to replace the player removed. Ten minutes are applied in the league records to the player incurring a game misconduct penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23.2 Fines and Suspensions&lt;/strong&gt; - A player incurring a game misconduct penalty shall be reported to the Commissioner who shall have full power to impose such further penalties by way of suspension or fine on the penalized player or any other player involved in the altercation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any game misconduct penalty for which a player has been assessed an automatic suspension or supplementary discipline in the form of game suspension(s) by the Commissioner shall not be taken into account when calculating the total number of offenses under this subsection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automatic suspensions incurred under this subsection in respect to League games shall have no effect with respect to violations during Playoff games.
Any request by a Club to have a game misconduct reviewed and rescinded by the League must submit their request in writing to the Hockey Operations Department within 48 hours of the conclusion of the game in which the game misconduct was assessed. Failure to submit the written request within this time frame will automatically result in the game misconduct being upheld and no further review of the incident will be considered or entertained. This does not apply to infractions addressed under Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23.3 Fines and Suspensions&lt;/strong&gt; – General Category - In regular League games, any player who incurs a total of three (3) game misconduct penalties in the “General Category” and exclusive of other designated categories, shall be suspended for the next League game of his team. For each subsequent game misconduct penalty, the automatic suspension shall be increased by one game. For each suspension of a player or goalkeeper, his Club shall be fined one thousand dollars ($1,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Playoff games, any player who incurs a total of two game misconduct penalties in the “General Category” shall be suspended automatically for the next Playoff game of his team. For each subsequent game misconduct penalty during the Playoffs, the automatic suspension shall be increased by one game. For each suspension of a player during Playoffs, his club shall be fined one thousand dollars ($1,000).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nhl: Penalty Shot</title>
      <link>/nhl/section-4--types-of-penalties/rule-24--penalty-shot/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/nhl/section-4--types-of-penalties/rule-24--penalty-shot/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24.1 Penalty Shot&lt;/strong&gt; – A penalty shot is designed to restore a scoring opportunity which was lost as a result of an infraction being committed by the offending team, based on the parameters set out in these rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24.2 Procedure&lt;/strong&gt; - The Referee shall have announced over the public address system the player designated by him or selected by the team entitled to take the shot (as appropriate). He shall then place the puck on the center face-off spot and the player taking the shot will, on the instruction of the Referee (by blowing his whistle), play the puck from there and shall attempt to score on the goalkeeper. The puck must be kept in motion towards the opponent’s goal line and once it is shot, the play shall be considered complete. No goal can be scored on a rebound of any kind (an exception being the puck off the goal post or crossbar, then the goalkeeper and then directly into the goal), and any time the puck crosses the goal line or comes to a complete stop, the shot shall be considered complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lacrosse-like move whereby the puck is picked up on the blade of the stick and “whipped” into the net shall be permitted provided the puck is not raised above the height of the shoulders at any time and when released, is not carried higher than the crossbar. See also 80.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spin-o-rama type move where the player completes a 360° turn as he approaches the goal, shall not be permitted. Should a player perform such a move during the shot, the shot shall be stopped by the Referee and no goal will be the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a player designated as a goalkeeper or alternate goalkeeper  may defend against a penalty shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goalkeeper must remain in his crease until the player taking a penalty shot has touched the puck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If at the time a penalty shot is awarded, the goalkeeper of the penalized team has been removed from the ice to substitute another player, the goalkeeper shall be permitted to return to the ice before the shot is taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team against whom the penalty shot has been assessed may replace their goalkeeper to defend against the shot, however, the substitute goalkeeper is required to remain in the game until the next stoppage of play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the penalty shot is being taken, players of both sides shall withdraw to the sides of the rink and in front of their own player’s bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24.3 Designated Player&lt;/strong&gt; – In cases where a penalty shot has been awarded to a player specifically fouled, that player shall be designated by the Referee to take the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all other cases where a penalty shot has been awarded, the shot shall be taken by a player selected by the Captain of the nonoffending team from the players on the ice at the time when the infraction was committed. Such selection shall be reported to the Referee and cannot be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If by reason of injury, the player designated by the Referee to take a penalty shot is unable to do so within a reasonable time, the shot may be taken by a player selected by the Captain of the non-offending team from the players on the ice when the infraction was committed. Such selection shall be reported to the Referee and cannot be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the player in respect to whom a penalty shot has been awarded commit an infraction in connection with the same play or circumstances, either before or after the shot has been awarded, he shall first be permitted to do so before being sent to the penalty bench to serve the penalty. Except when such penalty is for a game misconduct or match penalty in which case the shot shall be taken by a player selected by the Captain of the non-offending team from the players on the ice at the time when the infraction was committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24.4 Violations During the Shot&lt;/strong&gt; – Should the goalkeeper leave his crease prior to the player taking the penalty shot touches the puck, or commits any infraction, the Referee shall allow the shot to be taken. If the shot fails, he shall permit the shot to be taken over again. When an infraction worthy of a minor penalty is committed by the goalkeeperduring the shot causing it to fail, no penalty is assessed but the Referee shall permit the shot to be taken over again. Should a goalkeeper commit a second violation and the shot fails, he shall be assessed a misconduct penalty and the Referee shall permit the shot to be taken over again. A third such violation shall result in the goalkeeper being assessed a game misconduct penalty and the Referee shall permit the shot to be taken over again, against the alternate goalkeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a major or match penalty is committed by the goalkeeper that causes the shot to fail, the Referee shall permit the shot to be taken over again and the appropriate penalties shall be assessed to the goalkeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goalkeeper may attempt to stop the shot in any manner except by throwing his stick or any object, or by deliberately dislodging the goal, in which case a goal shall be awarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the shot, should the goalkeeper, in an attempt at making a save, dislodge the goal accidentally, the Referee shall make one of the following determinations:
(i) Award a goal if he deems the player would have scored into the area normally occupied by the net had it not been dislodged.
(ii) Allow the shot to be re-taken if he does not score or it could not be determined if the puck would have entered the area normally occupied by the net.
(iii) If the goal becomes dislodged after the puck has crossed the goal line thus ending the shot, the above determinations do not apply, the shot is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, while a penalty shot is being taken, any player, Coach or nonplaying Club personnel of the opposing team interferes with or distracts the player taking the shot and, because of such action, the shot fails, a second attempt shall be permitted. The Referee shall impose a bench minor penalty to the offending team, and if a player on the bench is responsible, a misconduct penalty on the player responsible shall be assessed. When a Coach or non-playing Club personnel is guilty of such an act, he shall be automatically suspended from the game, ordered to the dressing room and the matter will be reported to the Commissioner for possible further disciplinary action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, while the penalty shot is being taken, any player, goalkeeper, Coach or non-playing Club personnel of the team taking the shot interferes with or distracts the goalkeeper defending the shot and, because of such action, the shot is successful, the Referee shall rule no goal and shall impose a bench minor penalty to the offending team. If a player or goalkeeper on the bench is responsible, a misconduct penalty on the player or goalkeeper responsible shall be assessed. When a Coach or non-playing Club personnel is guilty of such an act, he shall be automatically suspended from the game, ordered to the dressing room and the matter will be reported to the Commissioner for possible further disciplinary action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If while the penalty shot is being taken a spectator throws any object onto the ice that in the judgment of the Referee interferes with the player taking the shot or the goalkeeper defending the shot, he shall permit the shot be taken again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, after a player’s stick has been ruled illegal, he attempts to take a penalty shot with a second stick that is also ruled illegal prior to taking the shot, the opportunity to take the shot shall be disallowed. The player shall be assessed one minor penalty for the first illegal stick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24.5 Face-Off Location&lt;/strong&gt; - If a goal is scored from a penalty shot, the puck shall be faced-off at center ice. If a goal is not scored, the puck shall be faced-off at either of the end face-off spots in the zone in which the penalty shot was attempted, except when another rule dictates the face-off location should be in an alternate location, such as when the point men enter the zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone faceoff circle or when the attacking team has been penalized on the same play (see Rule 76.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24.6 Results&lt;/strong&gt; - Should a goal be scored from a penalty shot, a further penalty to the offending player or goalkeeper shall not be applied unless the offense for which the penalty shot was awarded is a major, match or misconduct penalty, in which case the appropriate penalty shall be imposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the offense for which the penalty shot was awarded would normally incur a minor penalty, then regardless of the outcome of the shot, no further minor penalty shall be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the offense for which the penalty shot was awarded was to incur a double-minor penalty, or where the offending team is assessed an additional minor penalty on the same play, the first minor penalty is not assessed since the penalty shot was awarded to restore the lost scoring opportunity. The second minor penalty would be assessed and served regardless of whether the penalty shot results in a goal. This will be announced as a double-minor penalty for the appropriate infraction and the player will serve two (2) minutes only. No penalty shall expire when a goal is scored against a team on a penalty shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should two penalty shots be awarded to the same team at the same stoppage of play (two separate infractions), only one goal can be scored or awarded at a single stoppage of play. Should the first penalty shot result in a goal, the second shot would not be taken but the appropriate penalty would be assessed and served as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24.7 Timing&lt;/strong&gt; - If the infraction upon which the penalty shot is based occurs during actual playing time, the penalty shot shall be awarded and taken immediately in the usual manner notwithstanding any delay occasioned by a slow whistle by the Referee to allow play to continue until the attacking side has lost possession of the puck to the defending side, which delay results in the expiry of the regular playing time in any period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time required for the taking of a penalty shot shall not be included in the regular playing time or overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24.8 Infractions&lt;/strong&gt; – Refer to the Reference Tables – Table 11 – Summary of Penalty Shots (page 143) for a list of the infractions that shall result in a penalty shot being awarded (see specific rule numbers for complete descriptions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four (4) specific conditions that must be met in order for the Referee to award a penalty shot for a player being fouled from behind. They are:
(i) The infraction must have taken place in the neutral zone or attacking zone, (i.e. over the puck carrier’s own blue line);
(ii) The infraction must have been committed from behind;
(iii) The player in possession and control (or, in the judgment of the Referee, clearly would have obtained possession and control of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score (the fact that he got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the penalty shot consideration criteria. If the infraction was from behind and he was denied a “more” reasonable scoring opportunity due to the infraction, then the penalty shot should be awarded);
(iv) The player in possession and control (or, in the judgment of the Referee, clearly would have obtained possession and control of the puck) must have had no opposing player between himself and the goalkeeper.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25.1 Awarded Goal&lt;/strong&gt; – A goal will be awarded to the attacking team when the opposing team has taken their goalkeeper off the ice and an attacking player has possession and control of the puck (or would have gained possession and control) in the neutral or attacking zone, without a defending player between himself and the opposing goal, and he is prevented from scoring as a result of an infraction committed by the defending team (see 25.3 Infractions – When Goalkeeper is Off the Ice, below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25.2 Infractions – When Goalkeeper is On the Ice&lt;/strong&gt; – A goal will be awarded when an attacking player, with an imminent scoring opportunity, is prevented from scoring as a result of a defending player or goalkeeper displacing the goal post, either deliberately or accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25.4 Infractions – During the Course of a Penalty Shot&lt;/strong&gt; - A goal will be awarded when a goalkeeper attempts to stop a penalty shot by throwing his stick or any other object at the player taking the shot or by dislodging the goal (either deliberately or accidentally) (see Rule 63.7).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26.1 Delayed Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; - If a third player of any team is penalized while two players of the same team are serving penalties, the penalty time of the third player shall not commence until the penalty time of one of the two players already penalized has elapsed. The third penalized player must proceed at once to the penalty bench. He may be substituted for on the ice to keep the on-ice strength at no less than three skaters for his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26.2 Penalty Expiration&lt;/strong&gt; - When any team has three players serving
penalties at the same time and because of the delayed penalty rule, a
substitute for the third offender is on the ice, none of the three
penalized players on the penalty bench may return to the ice until play
has stopped. When play has been stopped, the player whose penalty
has fully expired may return to the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the play, the Penalty Timekeeper shall permit the penalized players to return to the ice, in the order of expiration of their penalties, but only when the penalized team is entitled to have more than four players on the ice. Otherwise, these players must wait until the first stoppage of play after the expiration of their penalties in order to be released from the penalty bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the penalties of two players of the same team will expire at the same time, the Captain of that team will designate to the Referee which player will return to the ice first and the Referee will instruct the Penalty Timekeeper accordingly (this is done to expedite the release of a player from the penalty bench when the opposing team scores on the power-play).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26.3 Major and Minor Penalty&lt;/strong&gt; - When a major and a minor penalty are imposed at the same time on different players of the same team, the Penalty Timekeeper shall record the minor as being the first penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27.1 Minor Penalty to Goalkeeper&lt;/strong&gt; – A goalkeeper shall not be sent to the penalty bench for an offense which incurs a minor penalty, but instead, the minor penalty shall be served by another member of his team who was on the ice when the offense was committed. This player is to be designated by the Coach of the offending team through the playing Captain and such substitute shall not be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A penalized player may not serve a goalkeeper’s penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the goalkeeper is involved in coincidental penalties being assessed and as a result, his team is required to play shorthanded due to additional penalties assessed to the goalkeeper, the player designated to serve the additional time penalties assessed to the goalkeeper may be any player as designated by the Coach of the offending team through the Captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27.2 Major Penalty to Goalkeeper&lt;/strong&gt; – A goalkeeper shall not be sent to the penalty bench for an offense which incurs a major penalty, but instead, the major penalty shall be served immediately by another member of his team who was on the ice when the offense was committed. This player is to be designated by the Coach of the offending team through the Captain and such substitute shall not be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a goalkeeper is assessed a major penalty plus a game misconduct, which is coincidental with a major or match penalty to the opposing team, no player is required to serve the goalkeeper’s penalties in the penalty box, since he has been ejected from the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should a goalkeeper incur three major penalties in one game, he shall be ruled off the ice for the balance of the game and his place shall be taken by a member of his own Club, or by a regular substitute goalkeeper who is available. Such player will be allowed the goalkeeper’s full equipment. (Major penalty plus game misconduct penalty.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27.3 Misconduct Penalty to Goalkeeper&lt;/strong&gt; – Should a goalkeeper on the ice incur a misconduct penalty, this penalty shall be served by another member of his team who was on the ice when the offense was committed. This player is to be designated by the Manager or Coach of the offending team through the Captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27.4 Game Misconduct Penalty to Goalkeeper&lt;/strong&gt; – Should a goalkeeper incur a game misconduct penalty, his place will then be taken by a member of his own Club, or by a regular substitute goalkeeper who is available, and such player will be allowed the goalkeeper’s full equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27.5 Match Penalty to Goalkeeper&lt;/strong&gt; – Should a goalkeeper incur a match penalty, his place will then be taken by a member of his own Club, or by a substitute goalkeeper who is available, and such player will be allowed the goalkeeper’s full equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The match penalty, and any additional penalties assessed to the goalkeeper, shall be served immediately by a member of the team on the ice when the offenses were committed. This player shall be designated by the Coach of the offending team through the Captain. However, when the match penalty is coincidental with a match or major penalty to the opposing team, no player is required to proceed to the penalty bench to serve the goalkeeper’s match penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27.6 Leaving Goal Crease&lt;/strong&gt; – A minor penalty shall be imposed on a goalkeeper who leaves the immediate vicinity of his crease during an altercation. In addition, he shall be reported to the Commissioner for further disciplinary action as may be required. However, should the altercation occur in or near the goalkeeper’s crease, the Referee should direct the goalkeeper to a neutral location and not assess a penalty for leaving the immediate vicinity of the goal crease. Equally, if the goalkeeper is legitimately outside the immediate vicinity of the goal crease for the purpose of proceeding to the players’ bench to be substituted for an extra attacker, and he subsequently becomes involved in an altercation, the minor penalty for leaving the crease would not be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, during stoppages of play in the game, he must not proceed to his players’ bench for the purpose of receiving a replacement stick or equipment or repairs thereto, or due to an injury, or to receive instructions, without first obtaining permission to do so from the Referee. Otherwise, he must be replaced by the substitute goalkeeper immediately (without any delay) or be assessed a bench minor penalty for delay of game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27.7 Participating in the Play Over the Center Red Line&lt;/strong&gt; - If a goalkeeper participates in the play in any manner (intentionally plays the puck or checks an opponent) when he is beyond the center red line, a minor penalty shall be imposed upon him. The position of the puck is the determining factor for the application of this rule.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28.1 Supplementary Discipline&lt;/strong&gt; - In addition to the automatic fines and suspensions imposed under these rules, the Commissioner may, at his discretion, investigate any incident that occurs in connection with any Pre-season, Exhibition, League or Playoff game and may assess additional fines and/or suspensions for any offense committed during the course of a game or any aftermath thereof by a player, goalkeeper, Trainer, Manager, Coach or non-playing Club personnel or Club executive, whether or not such offense has been penalized by the Referee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an investigation is requested by a Club or by the League on its own initiative, it must be initiated within twenty-four (24) hours following the completion of the game in which the incident occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28.2 Pre-Season and Exhibition Games&lt;/strong&gt; - Whenever suspensions are imposed as a result of infractions occurring during pre-season and exhibition games, the Commissioner shall exercise his discretion in scheduling the suspensions to ensure that no team shall be short more players in any regular League game than it would have been had the infractions occurred in regular League games.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1 Players’ Benches&lt;/strong&gt; - Each rink shall be provided with seats or benches for the use of players of both teams. The accommodations provided, including benches and doors, MUST be uniform for both teams. Such seats or benches shall have accommodation for at least fourteen (14) persons of each team. The benches shall be placed immediately alongside the ice as near to the center of the rink as possible. Two doors for each bench must be uniform in location and size and as convenient to the dressing rooms as possible.
Each players’ bench should be twenty-four feet (24&amp;rsquo;) in length and when situated in the spectator area, shall be separated from the spectators by a protective glass so as to afford the necessary protection for the players. The players’ benches shall be on the same side of the playing surface opposite the penalty bench and should be separated by a substantial distance, if possible.
Each players’ bench shall have two doors which must be uniform in location and size. (“Mirrored image benches”) All doors opening to the playing surface shall be constructed so that they swing inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2 Penalty Bench&lt;/strong&gt; - Each rink must be provided with benches or seats to be known as the “PENALTY BENCH.” These benches or seats must be capable of accommodating a total of ten persons including the OffIce Officials.

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.1 Captain&lt;/strong&gt; - One Captain shall be appointed by each team, and he alone shall have the privilege of discussing with the Referee any questions relating to interpretation of rules which may arise during the progress of a game. He shall wear the letter “C,” approximately three inches (3&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in height and in contrasting color, in a conspicuous -position on the front of his sweater. No co-Captains are permitted. Either one Captain and no more than two Alternate Captains, or no Captain and no more than three Alternate Captains are permitted (see 6.2).
Only the Captain, when invited to do so by the Referee, shall have the privilege of discussing any point relating to the interpretation of rules. Any Captain, Alternate Captain or any player who comes off the bench and makes any protest or intervention with the officials for any purpose shall be assessed a minor penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct under Rule 39 – Abuse of Officials. Should this protest continue, he may be assessed a misconduct penalty, and if it further continues, a game misconduct penalty shall be assessed.
A complaint about a penalty is NOT a matter “relating to the interpretation of the rules” and a minor penalty shall be imposed against any Captain, Alternate Captain or any other player making such a complaint.
The Referee and Official Scorer shall be advised, prior to the start of each game, the name of the Captain and the Alternate Captains of both teams.
No playing Coach or playing Manager or goalkeeper shall be permitted to act as Captain or Alternate Captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.2 Alternate Captains&lt;/strong&gt; – If the Captain is not on the ice, an Alternate Captain on the ice shall be accorded the privileges of the Captain. Alternate Captains shall wear the letter “A” approximately three inches (3&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) in height and in contrasting color, in a conspicuous position on the front of their sweaters.
Only when the Captain is not in uniform (or if there is no Captain), the Coach shall have the right to designate three Alternate Captains. This must be done prior to the start of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.1 Starting Line-up&lt;/strong&gt; - Prior to the start of the game, at the request of the Referee, the Manager or Coach of the visiting team is required to name the starting line-up to the Referee or Official Scorer.
Prior to the start of the game, the Manager or Coach of the home team, having been advised by the Official Scorer the names of the starting line-up of the visiting team, shall name the starting line-up of the home team. This information shall be conveyed by the Official Scorer to the Coach of the visiting team.
No change in the starting line-up of either team as given to the Official Scorer, or in the playing line-up on the ice, can be made unless reviewed and approved by the Referee prior to the start of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.2 Violation&lt;/strong&gt; - For an infraction of this rule, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed upon the offending team. This is an appeal play and must be brought to the Referee’s attention prior to the second face-off in the game. There is no penalty to the requesting team if their appeal is unsustained. The determining factor is the player or goalkeeper’s name, and not necessarily the player or goalkeeper’s number, must be correctly listed by the team.
In the event a team scores on the first shift of the game, and it is brought to the attention of the Referee by the opposing team that the team that scored did not have the correct starting line-up on the ice, the goal shall be allowed and a bench minor penalty assessed to the offending team for having an improper starting line-up. If the team that scores a goal on the first shift of the game challenges the starting lineup of the opposing team and the opposing team did not have the correct starting line-up, the scoring of the goal would nullify the bench minor penalty and no further penalties would be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.1 Injured Player&lt;/strong&gt; - When a player is injured or compelled to leave the ice during a game, he may retire from the game and be replaced by a substitute, but play must continue without the teams leaving the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the play, if an injured player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, he must do so at the players’ bench and not through any other exit leading from the rink. This is not a legal player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a penalized player has been injured, he may proceed to the dressing room without taking a seat on the penalty bench. If the injured player receives a minor penalty, the penalized team shall immediately put a substitute player on the penalty bench, who shall serve the penalty until such time as the injured player is able to return to the game. He would replace his teammate on the penalty bench at the next stoppage of play. If the injured player receives a major penalty, the penalized team shall place a substitute player on the penalty bench before the penalty expires and no other replacement for the penalized player shall be permitted to enter the game except from the penalty bench. For violation of this rule, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the injured penalized player who has been replaced on the penalty bench return to his players’ bench prior to the expiration of his penalty, he shall not be eligible to play until his penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when his substitute is still in the penalty box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured player must wait until his substitute has been released from the penalty box before he is eligible to play. If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of his penalty, he must then replace his teammate on the penalty bench and is then eligible to return once his penalty has expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a player is injured so that he cannot continue play or go to his bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured player’s team has secured control of the puck. If the player’s team is in control of the puck at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless his team is in a scoring position.
In the case where it is obvious that a player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesperson may stop the play immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured player, or whenever an injured player is attended to on the ice by the Trainer or medical personnel, such player must be substituted for immediately. This injured player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When play is stopped for an injured player, the ensuing face-off shall be conducted at the face-off spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured player’s team has control of the puck in the attacking zone, the face-off shall be conducted at the nearest face-off spot in the neutral zone. When the injured player is in his defending zone and the attacking team is in possession of the puck in the attacking zone, the face-off shall be conducted at the nearest face-off spot in the defending team’s zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.2 Injured Goalkeeper&lt;/strong&gt; - If a goalkeeper sustains an injury or becomes ill, he must be ready to resume play immediately or be replaced by a substitute goalkeeper and no additional time shall be allowed for the purpose of enabling the injured or ill goalkeeper to resume his position. The substitute goalkeeper shall be allowed a two (2) minute warm-up during all pre-season games. No warm-up shall be permitted for a substitute goalkeeper in all regular League or Playoff games.
The Referee shall report to the Commissioner for disciplinary action any delay in making a goalkeeper substitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substitute goalkeeper shall be subject to the regular rules governing goalkeepers and shall be entitled to the same privileges.
When a substitution for the regular goalkeeper has been made, such regular goalkeeper shall not resume his position until the next stoppage of play. For a violation of the rule, a minor penalty for delay of game shall be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured goalkeeper, such goalkeeper must be substituted for only if he has to proceed to the players’ bench to receive medical attention. If the Trainer has come onto the ice to attend to the goalkeeper and there is no undue delay, the goalkeeper may remain in the game. However, no additional time shall be permitted by the Referee for the purpose of enabling the injured goalkeeper to resume his position (i.e. no warm-up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.3 Blood&lt;/strong&gt; – A player who is bleeding or who has visible blood on his equipment or body shall be ruled off the ice at the next stoppage of play. Such player shall not be permitted to return to play until the bleeding has been stopped and the cut or abrasion covered (if necessary). It is required that any affected equipment and/or uniform be properly decontaminated or exchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
